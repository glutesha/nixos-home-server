## NixOS Home server
This is my configuration for the home server i've made fully out of junk hardware parts and my old PC case. Right now im hosting my stuff using docker, but i'll move all of the services to nix soon and migrate to flakes.     
I've just started my Nix and NixOS journey, so wish me luck.
